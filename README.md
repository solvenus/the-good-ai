# The Good AI
AI that understands well-being and protects humanity.

The Good AI (Norwegian: Den gode AI) is a new paradigm for large language models.

It removes human effort from alignment training and may render RLHF obsolete,
while profoundly increasing the quality, precision, and density of feedback.
To a level unseen, so far.

It may solve both alignment and hallucination simultaneously.
Without anyone lifting a finger, so to speak. 

And that's just the by-products.
Of letting AI listen to the human soul.

**Our soul can only create one kind of AI. GOOD!**

The Good AI enhances human well-being
